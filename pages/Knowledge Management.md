# Knowledge Management

## Tools

## Why do I need to build this out?
I am passionate about Data Engineering and anything to do with Data. Having spent over 10+ years with Data, I have come to realize that there are tons of things that I still need to know. With very active communities across the global, there are many trying to attempt to solve problems and be future ready. This is my attempt to keep up the pace in area of my interests and concerns. 

## Way of working
I am trying to build my knowledge to handle Big Data problems with latest cutting edge technologies. On a very high level, here are few things that I am concentrating on -

### Programming Language
- Java
- Scala
- Python
- Rust
- Go
- SQL

### Cloud Native Technologies
This itself is a very big space. At the top of my head are containers and its orchestration, building softwares natives (focus on 12factors for cloud readiness). So, if we breakdown into tech stacks
- Containerization and Orchestraction
    - This includes Docker, containerd and Kubernetes
- Observability
    - This includes logging, telemetry, ELK, monitoring, etc.
- Software Practices
    - This includes DevOps, Agile, Project Management, etc
- Cloud Service Providers
    - Big 3. Current focus on AWS

### Distributed computing
This includes details on hadoop, netty, grpc. There are many flavors of this. 
- Distributed Compute - Hadoop and Flink
- Distributed Storage - Blobs and HDFS
- Distributed Database concept (which is little bit of both above). Seprate section on this topic

### Data Formats
While this is a very vast scope it in itself, I think i am interested in
- Parquet and Orc
- In memory format - Arrow
- csv and text
- Delta Lake

### Databases
NoSQL based
Graph based
Ignite (which internally uses calcite)

### Data Movement
- Realtime: Apache Kafka
- Batch: ??

### Data Sciences
- R based

### Machine Learning

### Artificial Intelligence

## Structuring
It is not easy to structure all of these in the most efficient. Not to say that there would be more coming my way. Will I have the discipline of keeping the right focus or will I keep expanding the scope?
Lets use Logseq to jot down learnings. Unless something becomes significant effort, it would not make its own in into its dedicated page.
I will use folder structure to manage knowledge.
