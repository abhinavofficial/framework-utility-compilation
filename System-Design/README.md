# System Design

## Modern System Architecture

System architecture is the study of early decision-making in complex systems. We will first learn how to capture experience and analysis about early system decisions. We will also learn you how to choose architectures that meet stakeholder needs, integrate easily, and evolve flexibly.

Most importantly, we’ll examine how to think, not what to think. The goal is to help develop a way of thinking about and implementing system architecture by placing it in the context of value and competitive advantage for the product and organization.

We’ll learn to manage the evolution of system complexity and account for future uncertainty so goals are met and functions are delivered. This will also ensure that the system remains fully comprehensible during its design, implementation, operation, and evolution.

The framework starts by defining the solution-neutral function based on the underlying need. Then comes the concept, which is generated based on the solution-neutral function. Finally, the architecture is created based on the concept.

This tool is called Design Structure Matrix (DSM). DSM helps you understand the interactions among entities, subsystems, and components. It also allows you to manage these interactions to align product development with the goals and needs of the system.

## Key Ideas

Function to architecture. Solution neutral functions. Concept.

The requirement should be provided in a solution neutral way, so it allows designers to bring in different ways to solve a problem.

Definitions:

* **Architecture** is a representation of entities organized in a way that supports reasoning about the entities and describes behaviors and relationships amongst the entities.
* A **concept** is a product or system vision, idea, notion, or mental image that maps function to form in brief. It is a simplification of the system architecture that allows for high-level reasoning.
* A **solution-neutral** function explains a function without specifying the solution that allows one to achieve that function. Solution-neutral is not an absolute property but rather a spectrum of more solution-neutral to less solution-neutral.

Examples of solution-neutral and solution-specific

|Solution-Neutral       |Solution-Specific              |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
|Controlling a vehicle  |Steering a vehicle             |
|Sorting an Array       |Sequentially exchanging entries|
|Identifying a package  |Lidar Scanning                 |
|Air pressure regulating|Actuating Blow Off value       |

Please note: Solution-neutral is relative, not absolute. Any requirement is more or less solution-neutral relative to another possible requirement. This spectrum is illustrated by the range of problem framings given in the video for a wine bottle opener.

> * Solution-neutral function is stated without reference to how the function is achieved.
> * Functional intent for a system should be stated as a solution-neutral function.
> * A solution-neutral statement doesn’t contain any reference to a specific product/process, so it doesn’t set the design parameters.

Less solution-neutral is focus and team's exploratory perspective is constrained. Useful is responding to a competition or challenge.

### Concept

You're already familiar with concepts such as the vision, or the idea, or the kernel at the heart of the architecture. Professor Cameron, from MIT xPro argues that concept requires both function (process) and form (operand) and defines it as the mapping of function to form.

If you list down the number of functions you need to perform, and all the forms that can do these functions individually, we can generate a lot of concepts using their combinations.

|x                         |Operand|Process |Instrument|
|--------------------------|-------|--------|----------|
|Operand/Process/Instrument|light  |emitting|diode     |
|Operand/Process           |lawn   |mow     |(er)      |
|Operand/Instrument        |light  |        |bulb      |
|Process/Instrument        |       |carrying|case      |

The concept name can lock us in some kind of solution.

Architect Steve Emerie rationalizes the structure of the architecture.

In summary, a concept:

* Is the transition point from the solution-neutral to the solution-specific.
* Must allow for value-related functions to be executed and enabled by form.
* Establishes the vocabulary for the solution and is the beginning of the development of architecture.
* Implicitly sets the design parameters of the system.
* Implicitly sets the level of technology

## Questions

1. What is the difference between concept and instruments.
2. Is function same as process? Is form same as operand?
