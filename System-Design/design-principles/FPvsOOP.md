# Procedure Design and Object-Oriented Design

In Functional Program, function is the first class citizen. This is what provides the level of abstraction.

Procedural Design is not the same as Functional Program. In procedural program, we are focusing on breaking down a larger program into smaller program - each of which is function or procedure.
In Object-Oriented Design, the primary level of abstraction is an entity or a class or an object.

Algol -> Simula -> 
Modula -> Modularity

Alan Kay introduced Object-Oriented.

## Functional Program

We would be learning functional programming using Scala. The knowledge would be tracked under [Functional Programming Using Scala](https://github.com/abhinavofficial/scala-learning/blob/main/functional-programming-using-scala.md)
