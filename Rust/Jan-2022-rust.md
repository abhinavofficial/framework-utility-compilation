## Neural Search Engine in Rust
* **Product Name**: Qdrant
* **About Authors**: [Qdrant Tech](https://qdrant.tech/) 
* **About Product**: Qdrant is a vector similarity search engine. It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points - vectors with an additional payload. Qdrant is tailored to extended filtering support. It makes it useful for all sorts of neural network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications.

## pola-rs
* **Product Name**: Polars
* **About Authors**: [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/) by Xomnia
* **About Product**: Polars is lightning-fast DataFrame library for Rust and Python. Its embarrassingly parallel execution, cache efficient algorithms and expressive API makes it perfect for efficient data wrangling, data pipelines, snappy APIs and so much more. Polars is about as fast as it gets, see the results in the H2O.ai [benchmark](https://h2oai.github.io/db-benchmark/). It uses [Arrow2](https://github.com/jorgecarleitao/arrow2) under the hood. Arrow2 is a faster and safer implementation of the Apache Arrow Columnar Format. Arrow2 also has a more granular code base, helping to reduce the compiler bloat. Will put Arrow two under file format section.

## Vector: A lightweight, ultra-fast tool for building observability pipelines
* **Product Name**: Vector
* **About Authors**: [Vector](https://vector.dev/) by Datadog
* **About Product**: Vector is a high-performance, end-to-end (agent & aggregator) observability data pipeline that puts you in control of your observability data. Collect, transform, and route all your logs, metrics, and traces to any vendors you want today and any other vendors you may want tomorrow. Vector enables dramatic cost reduction, novel data enrichment, and data security where you need it, not where it is most convenient for your vendors. Additionally, it is open source and up to 10x faster than every alternative in the space.

## GUI in Rust
There are multiple frameworks available in Rust at different level of maturity. [areweguiyet.com](areweguiyet.com) kind of compiles them all and present an excellent way to look at all the options.

## Pijul
* **Product Name**: Pijul
* **About Authors**: [Pijul](https://pijul.com/)
* **About Product**: Pijul is a free and open source (GPL2) distributed version control system written in Rust. Its distinctive feature is to be based on a theory of patches, while still being fast and scalable. This makes it easy to learn and use, without any compromise on power or features.
