# Metrics and Dashboards

Nowadays, measuring application and system performance via the collection of metrics is common practice in software development. This data is converted into graphs to generate meaningful visualizations for those in charge of monitoring the health of a system.

These metrics can also be used to configure alerting when certain thresholds have been reached, such as when an error rate becomes greater than an acceptable percentage. In certain environments, metrics are used to automate workflows as a reaction to changes in the system, such as increasing the number of application instances or rolling back a bad deployment. As with logging, over time, many vendors and projects provided their own solutions to metrics, dashboards, monitoring, and alerting. Some of the open source projects that focus on metrics are as follows:

* Prometheus – https://prometheus.io
* StatsD – https://github.com/statsd/statsd
* Graphite – https://graphiteapp.org
* Grafana – https://github.com/grafana/grafana
