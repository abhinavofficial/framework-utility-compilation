## History of OpenTelemetry

In early 2019, the OpenTelemetry project was announced as a merger of two existing open source projects: [OpenTracing](opentracing/README.md) and [OpenCensus](opencensus/README.md). Although initially, the goal of this endeavor was to bring these two projects together, its ambition to provide an observability framework for cloud-native software goes much further than that.
