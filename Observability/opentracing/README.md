# Open Tracing
The OpenTracing (https://opentracing.io) project, started in 2016, was focused on solving the problem of increasing the adoption of distributed tracing as a means for users to better understand their systems. One of the challenges identified by the project was that adoption was difficult because of cost instrumentation and the lack of consistent quality instrumentation in third-party libraries. OpenTracing provided a specification for Application Programming Interface (APIs) to address this problem. This API could be leveraged independently of the implementation that generated distributed traces, therefore allowing application developers and library authors to embed calls to this API in their code. By default, the API would act as a no-op operation, meaning those calls wouldn't do anything unless an implementation was configured.
