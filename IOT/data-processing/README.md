# Data Processing Paradigms in IoT

## Stream Processing
* Data processed immediately for real-time analytics
* Insights/alerts/notifications needed quickly, processed on a stream of individual data objects
* Types
  * Real-time: Immediate processing on each input, in device, edge or cloud based on timing requirements
  * Periodic: Seconds or Minutes in time window, to validate continuity of alert conditions or to generate mini-averages
* Requires relatively low processing power but continuous high availability

## Batch Processing
* Data processed together in larger time periods
* Builds data connections for trends, correlations, insights, historical analysis
* Requires heavy processing power for limited time periods
