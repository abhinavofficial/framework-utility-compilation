# AWS IoT

This module will also cover the AWS IoT.

## Skills/Tools Learnt

All these following topics will be covered in a more detailed manner and in-depth along with applications and examples. Let's evaluate few of the use cases [IoT Use Cases in HealthCare](../use-cases/use-case-healthcare.md). Based on these use cases and architecture requirements, we need a good cloud solution. This is where we will explore AWS cloud services. This would be documented at [AWS Services](aws-services.md) and  also include: 
* AWS IoT Core - Introduction and Concepts 
* IoT Core and DynamoDB

## Objectives

After completing this week, you will:
* Understand what is AWS IoT
* Become familiar with AWS IoT applications and use-cases
* Get introduced to AWS IoT Core and Amazon DynamoDB

Weâ€™ll focus on using Cloud (AWS) services to ingest, store, process, and analyse the data. This will include:
* AWS IoT Core and device connection/communication
* DynamoDB for data storage
* Stream processing for handling alerts and notifications
* Batch processing, using Spark, for transforming data for analytics and reports 
* Multiple statistical and analytical processes for finding correlations, analyzing trends, and creating visualizations
