# IOT Analytics

## Use cases
Look for patterns

### Environment

* Security & Safety

### Health
* Health Monitoring
* Patient Care
* Fitness enhancement
* Sports (and performance enhancement)

### Transport
* Autonomous Vehicle Performance
* Driver-less car
* Traffic Control and Routing
* Smart Parking

## IoT Analytics - What is different?

### Availability of data
* Connected devices enable data collection
* Heterogeneous sensors and input data formats
* Numerous possibilities of correlation of data
* High volume, velocity and variety of data

### Types of data
* Continuous time-series data (some of them may be "well-known" data like heart rate or activity data)
* Irregular data created by anomaly detection
* Low frequency but complex data generated by diagnostics
* Formats - Time Series, Image/Video streams, Tabular, Textual, Location Data, etc.

### Processing variation
* These are typically by choice.
* Periodic output with feedback to optimize operations
* Predictive maintenance based on diagnostic data (time-series data) comparison with baseline
* Long term model building and enhancements, for ML use cases
* Deriving correlations for business understanding and improvements
* Aggregate visualization for business process and operational monitoring

### Storage and Enrichment
* Storage of relevant data (raw and processed)
* Data enrichment merging multiple streams and adding additional relevant data outside of sensors
* Unique data modeling requirements for aggregate, time series, and correlated data

### The "additional" need syndrome
This is something we must be able to avoid
* Since we have the data, we have to process it and store it
* Compute to check rather than compute with a purpose
* Overwhelming the infrastructure by computing and storage needs
* Large overheads for assumed future needs. We should predict future needs.
* Unstructured decoupled systems leading to duplicate processing and storage

## Architecture and Design Considerations for IoT Analytics
* Processing topology - Various steps can be split between device, edge and cloud
* Ingestion
  * Ingest data from multiple sources - Streams and Databases 
  * Transformations to homogenize data formats
  * Preprocessing - Clear outliers and errors
  * Merge multiple streams with enrichment
* Availability - High availability for stream ingestion
* Storage
  * Store raw and processed data in specialized data models - Time series, Flexible schemas
  * Deep querying capabilities to supply data for various analytic use cases
* Data security - Encryption at rest, access control, personal data scrubbing
* Compute
  * On-demand high scaling capabilities for ML model generation and processing
  * Ongoing highly available compute demand for near real-time analytics requirements
* Visualization - Trend visualization, slice-and-dice capabilities for business intelligence
* Structured support for deep-tech machine learning and statistical techniques

## IoT Analytics - Stages
* Data Generation and Communication
* Data Collection and Pre-processing (Cleaning, format normalization included) - Edge/Fog/Cloud Compute
* Data Processing - Batch / Streaming / Hybrid
* Data Analytics - Trend Analysis, Real time Analytics, Predictive Analytics, Data Mining

## IoT Analytics - Types
* **Descriptive Analytics** - Describe incoming IoT data and visualize patterns. Find statistical parameters, understand data distribution and spread, pattern recognition
* **Prescriptive Analytics** - Taking decision on future actions and optimizations. Image/Video processing, ML model data feed, diagnostics. Leading to parameter and workflow optimizations
* **Predictive Analytics** - Predict future data points using historical data. Regression, Time Series forecasting, and other complex ML algorithms

## Time Series Data 
By and large, IoT data is timely collection of data (and therefore time series data).
Time Series Data is a collection of immutable data points obtained by periodic (or irregular) measurements over time. Example -
- Air quality related values captured every hour
- GPS location data collected every ten seconds
- Vehicle throughput at a busy traffic signal captured every five minutes
- Anomalies detected in real-time heart rate measurements - Irregular

Sub-types:
* Trend Analysis: Spectral analysis - Cyclic/Seasonal Behaviour, Auto-correlation, Change Visualization
* Predictive Analysis: Extrapolation by curve fitting, Forecasting 
* Anomaly Detection:Segment comparison against baseline models - Rule-based or ML
