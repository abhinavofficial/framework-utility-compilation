# Introduction to IoT

## How did it all start?
It all started with RFID and "The Coffee Protocol".
RFID - Innovation to identify and track-n-trace. It was a lightweight passive identifiers powered by RFID reader. There were larger active tags with power, for long-distance reads(100+ meters) - Object could allow to identify itself.

[RFC 2324](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2324) published on 1st April, 1998 - Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol, popularly known as "coffee protocol".

[The Computer of the 21st Century](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~corps/phaseii/Weiser-Computer21stCentury-SciAm.pdf), a paper by Mark Weiser's Paper on Ubiquitous Computing (1991) - The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life
until they are indistinguishable from it.

Internet of Things - coined by [Kevin Ashton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Ashton) in 1999. Follow him on medium to learn more about his ideas (https://medium.com/@kevin_ashton)

## What does it mean to us?

Internet of Things is
* A network of physical objects
* The objects collect and exchange data which can be stored
* Built for a specific purpose
* Example: Thermostat, Security System, Remote Control

It has evolved and enhanced with the advent of multiple technologies and is now all across us. Examples -
* Embedded systems
* Wireless Communications
* Real-time analytics
* Cloud computing
* Artificial Intelligence
* Machine Learning
Electromechanical systems can really make dramatic shifts in life.

## Use cases
* Asset Monitoring and Tracking
  * Remote monitoring - status, functioning and location, say geofencing
  * Control - On/Off, working modes
* Operational Excellence
  * Data driven productivity
  * Data based operational improvements
* Analytics - Predict
  * Anticipate need for preventive maintenance
  * Take proactive actions - lead time, supply chain
* Smart Devices
* Systems - Productivity increase

## IoT - Elements
* Sensor - They sense, digitize, signal conditioning and collect data. Examples: Sensor for temperature, pressure, air quality. Sensor with something else can be device.
* Communication - Wired and wireless. Examples: LAN, Modbus, WiFi, GSM. This forms the backbone of how sensors and other systems would exchange data and solve for purpose. It can be peer-to-peer or network.
* Gateway - Immediate component. Pre-process, filter, process (convert into a format which a server can understand), aggregate. A gateway can support multiple protocols - it can have digital input-output, RS232, RS485, LAN, USB, etc.
* Server - Collect, pre-process, process. It also stores in persistent storage (Database)
* Access Systems - Allows access to various components of IoT Elements
