# Things in Internet of Things

We have seen that there are devices and sensors which actually pick up the data which gets to the servers either via gateways or mobile phones (as gateways or preprocessors). These devices sense data which can be correlated to build a complete use case around them. There are also actuators, which take decision from the system (server) and send it back to the field.
