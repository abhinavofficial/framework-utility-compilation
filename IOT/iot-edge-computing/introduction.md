# Introduction

Compute, Storage and RAM required for IoT has always existed on the Cloud infrastructure. In fact, it has now increased - we have more of these in small space requirement. Network, communication, quantum of data can be transported has also increased. While this is at the large capacity scale, the small capacity side things like microprocessors, devices have become more intelligent. Devices themselves have significant processing power and are now packaged with fair amount of storage and RAM. Some devices have multiple cores available as well.

If you see these three components - devices, network and Cloud, edge computing seems like a good alternative to sending things on cloud each time. This allows the processing locally within gateway, which forms one of the basis of edge of the cloud.

## What is edge computing?
* Edge Computing Paradigm
  * Distributed computing at the edge  of cloud 
  * Proximity - closer to the user/need
* Today’s Edge
  * IoT Friendly - Massive amount of data
  * Processed at the “Edge”
  * Broad definition and implementation
* Characteristics
  * Increased efficiency
  * Data and Security - Edge vs. Cloud
  * Fault tolerant
