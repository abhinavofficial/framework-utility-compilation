# Frequently asked questions

## Why did we not build practice first?
Inner-sourcing is a cultural shift toward collaboration. It needs to develop organically by people and their aspirations. In my opinion, setting up practices often lead to establishment of narrowed vision of inner-sourcing. It is not necessary that all the organizations benefit from inner-sourcing, in fact it can be detrimental in many cases - for example, if practices might view the process of inner-sourcing plan for projects as immature and might start influencing its metrics prematurely. This also leads to sunk cost dilemma, where practices tries more and more patch to avoid losses on investment made, and finally leading to poor inner-source community.
