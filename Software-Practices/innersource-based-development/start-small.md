# Start Small


In the early stages of a project, you’re experimenting with new ideas and making decisions based on what you want. As your project increases in popularity, you’ll find yourself working with your users and contributors more.

Maintaining a project requires more than code. These tasks are often unexpected, but they’re just as important to a growing project. We’ve gathered a few ways to make your life easier, from documenting processes to leveraging your community.


Start with one project. However, recognize the set of challenges which were highlighted in the Challenges section. The idea is to implement all the best practices within one project, so it can be used as a model project.

## Define the vision
Start by writing down the goals of your project. Add them to your README, or create a separate file called VISION.

Having a clear, documented vision keeps you focused and helps you avoid “scope creep” from others’ contributions.

## Define initial features to be built
A publicly accessible project roadmap helps tremendously.

## Establish the minimum toolset required to work on the project

## Define practices for versioning and release cycle


## Define standards of code build, test and documentation

## Create the Kanban board to implement the changes

## Building of appropriate mindset to welcome contribution
One of the key factors to achieve is depersonalization. This enhances collaboration and minimizes conflicts. 
Having everything written down, however, helps depersonalize situations when you do need to enforce your rules. Saying no applies to many situations you’ll come across as a maintainer: feature requests that don’t fit the scope, someone derailing a discussion, doing unnecessary work for others.
