# Community based development

Open source and inner source are similar in that they both involve collaboration and sharing of software development resources, but they differ in terms of their scope and target audience.

Open source refers to a software development model in which the source code of a software product is made available to the public, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute the code. This approach encourages collaboration and innovation among developers, who can work together to create better software products that benefit the entire community.

Inner source, on the other hand, is a software development model in which the principles of open source development are applied within a single organization. In an inner source model, the organization's software development resources are shared across teams, enabling greater collaboration, reuse, and knowledge sharing.

Both open source and inner source promote transparency, collaboration, and innovation in software development, but inner source is typically more focused on improving internal development processes and productivity, while open source is focused on creating high-quality, community-driven software products that are freely available to the public.


## Setting the context
For a wide inner source adoption (meaning a majority of projects run with an inner source strategy), there is a mindset change required at the organization level, typically influenced by the leadership. They can support by constructing an organizational program office with various project representatives as participating members and independent reviewers and support functions, responsible for 
* setting up and communicating policies, strategies and standards inline with organization's long term plans and industry best practices,
* measuring and distributing metrics,
* making appropriate tools available,
* simplifying and unblocking governance challenges,
* enabling collaboration amongst inner source projects,
* ensuring minimal fund / resource time for projects to run, and
* avoiding any legal risks due to projects in use.

The execution of the inner source project is managed at the project level operating inline with policies, strategies and standards as defined by inner source program office. In general, the goal of an inner source project is to build out a project based on its vision. Typically, the base project is developed by a limited set of people to solve a particular problem or a set of related problems, which forms the purpose and vision of project. While the purpose and vision may change over the period of time, it generally is a refinement or expansion of the initial one. If its purpose resonates and finds utility with a larger group of people, one of the options is that the original team may want to turn the project into an inner source project to meet the demands for a larger group.

## The challenge
This mode of development bring its own set of challenges. Let me take a dig on few of them.

* How to ensure that purpose of the project is being respected?
* How people get to discuss what should be built?
* What is governance and development framework under which people develop and release the product?
* Is the above framework trusted by watchers / adopters?
* How do watchers (interested parties) know what will be released when? How will the new release be adopted?
* What is the support available for each version of project released for developers and adopters?

As you can now imagine, for an inner source project to succeed, some of these core attributes need to firmed up. There are many best practices already documented online to take the inspiration from. This would typically be set up by program office, and enhanced / implemented by individual projects.

The document focuses on building out inner source practices within an organization, which may be highly regulated like Banks and Financial Institutions, Pharmaceuticals, Telecoms, etc. It also focuses on lower the entry barrier to enable transition. Organization matured with inner source practices may not need to use this document - though may be useful, if they would like to reflect to simplification when there are too many projects.

## Structure of this document
This document is structured in various sections to address key challenges as listed out in the section The challenge. Each of the sections tries to set up the transition plan to establish the process as a beginner to matured adoption of community based development.

It follows an agile methodology and product development strategy for building out the inner source practices.
