# Build out Inner Source Practice
This is the final stage of inner-sourcing, after which the practice matures with continuous improvement. If you have reach this far, you are close to realizing a wide-scale inner-sourcing.

By this time, you have several metrics across few related inner-sourced projects, support from leadership, a basic functioning UI which makes projects discoverable.

At this stage, the goal is to scale inner-sourcing by setting a supporting program office and further lowering the barriers for new entrants to inner-sourced project

## Setting Program Office
There are many resources to help [set up a program office](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/resources/open-source-guides/creating-an-open-source-program).

It needs to a lean team to reap the cost benefits, with participating members from projects.

## Enhancing Developer Experience
As projects mature, teams would need 
* Better toolsets, development environments, DevSecOps platform, containerized orchestration and incubation environment.
* Lowered barrier to new entrant to an inner-source project
* Simplified change governance
* Help to get projects audit ready
* Enhance participation in open source community
* Priority for GitLab adoption

## Protecting teams from legal issues and setting patenting process
There is a chance that teams may be developing projects in violation of someone's IP. Program office needs to keep the team cleared off any such violations when project is put in incubation phase. It must also help team file for patents if the work is original or extension to existing working.

## Setting Code of conduct and Licensing
It may be prudent to set up code of conduct - they should consult the existing projects while setting up the code of conduct. It is possible that operational risk framework is aligned to support code of conduct.

It is also advisable to build licensing model for all the inner-source project. If the organization wants to monetize any of its work, it can do so based on appropriate licensing.

## Setting up standardized glossary
> _It takes only a small misinterpretation to commit a himalayan blunder_ 

One of the key goals for program office to establish consistent usage of terminologies. It must maintain glossary which can be referred to understand the meaning of a term and help people align their understandings.

## Setting up project maturity model
I personally recommend [Apache's project maturity model](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html#the-apache-project-maturity-model).

## Making Project Discoverable
While in increasing the influence stage, a simple UI was introduced. This can be upgraded to be more informative including project's metrics.

## Meetup for Inner Source projects
* Setting up Inner-Source couple of days conferences across the locations to increase awareness.
* Half-yearly Weekend Hackathons
* Decentralized project meet-up with small fund for get together

## Celebrations
One of the most important role for Program office is to celebrate successes.
