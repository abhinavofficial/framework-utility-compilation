# Influence for InnerSource
Congratulations, you have come a long way. You have started small - with one or two projects and involved like-minded colleagues, probably within your hierarchy during the journey. You have evidences proving your point. You have shown the value that can be derived using InnerSourcing.

Next step should be to increase the area of influence. Finally, InnerSource may only succeed or get to desire state when an appreciable mass believes the same.

## Build the mindset around InnerSource
This section can virtually be implemented in any large scale implementation.

You have a hypothesis, and you want to understand the probability of hypothesis given a condition for success. WIP...

## Convince your leader

If innersource is working.

Organizations that use InnerSource experience benefits that are typical of open source development, such as:

* **High-quality code**: With unit tests, code coverage, and continuous integration, teams improve code quality earlier in the lifecycle.
* **Comprehensive documentation**: Code is better documented, both in comments and less formally in discussions, leading to a single source of truth and increased transparency and shared knowledge. 
* **Effective code reuse**: Code and architecture are discoverable and available across teams and the organization. 
* **Strong collaboration**: Code reviews have less friction, communication becomes stronger, and contributions increase in number. 
* **Healthy culture**: Silos are broken down, so developer job satisfaction improves, leading to better retainment and recruitment.
