If innersource is working.

Organizations that use InnerSource experience benefits that are typical of open source development, such as:

* **High-quality code**: With unit tests, code coverage, and continuous integration, teams improve code quality earlier in the lifecycle.
* **Comprehensive documentation**: Code is better documented, both in comments and less formally in discussions, leading to a single source of truth and increased transparency and shared knowledge. 
* **Effective code reuse**: Code and architecture are discoverable and available across teams and the organization. 
* **Strong collaboration**: Code reviews have less friction, communication becomes stronger, and contributions increase in number. 
* **Healthy culture**: Silos are broken down, so developer job satisfaction improves, leading to better retainment and recruitment.
