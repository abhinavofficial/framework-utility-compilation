# Influence for InnerSource
Congratulations, you have come a long way. You have started small - with one or two projects and involved like-minded colleagues, probably within your hierarchy during the journey. You have evidences proving your point. You have shown the value that can be derived using InnerSourcing, and have been able to build ecosystem around your project.

Next step should be to increase the area of influence. InnerSource may only succeed or get to desire state when an appreciable mass believes the same. Leaders within the organization play a very critical role -
1. To layout organization roadmap along the lines of inner-sourcing and promote the same
2. To secure minimum funding to the ecosystem to thrive and incentivize the process
3. To play master servant role within Program Office and restrict getting inner-sourcing working by direct involvement. 

## Convince your leader
Organizations that use InnerSource experience benefits that are typical of open source development, such as:

* **High-quality code**: With unit tests, code coverage, and continuous integration, teams improve code quality earlier in the lifecycle.
* **Comprehensive documentation**: Code is better documented, both in comments and less formally in discussions, leading to a single source of truth and increased transparency and shared knowledge.
* **Effective code reuse**: Code and architecture are discoverable and available across teams and the organization.
* **Strong collaboration**: Code reviews have less friction, communication becomes stronger, and contributions increase in number.
* **Healthy culture**: Silos are broken down, so developer job satisfaction improves, leading to better retention and recruitment.

You have data to show if organization can adopt inner-sourcing. If your leader trusts the data and believe in possible great outcomes of inner-sourcing, he can
* Secure some small base funding, so collaboration based events like hackathon can be held. Inner-Source projects can advertise for contributors.  
* Make remarks in town-hall.
* Share the vision for organization with several inner-sourced projects.
* Volunteer projects under their organizations to be inner-sourced. 

## Build the mindset around InnerSource
This section can virtually be implemented in any large scale implementation.

You have a hypothesis, and you want to understand the probability of hypothesis given a condition for success. WIP...

## Expand the purview of projects under Inner-sourcing
The projects need not be elaborate. We typically target the medium size project in our attempt to start small. But, the overall ecosystem thrives when there are many small modularized projects, solving very specific purpose. These smaller project must again have the same thought process as a regular medium to large project. It must clearly define its purpose, way to usage, etc.

At this point, it is critical to ensure that all these development is happening under a standardized DevOps pipeline. The more the deviation, the greater is barrier for adoption. This means, the artifactory and repository is easily accessible, code quality and consistency are well understood, release notes and user documentation are good enough for users / contributors to make use and provide feedback.

It is strongly encouraged to add meaningful tags to repo, so that people can search these projects.

It is very important to clearly state ONLY what the module does - nothing more and nothing less. Unvalidated or untested claims that the module delivers, often hurt the community at large and deters confidence in inner-sourcing, and hence MUST be avoided. These things get picked up when the practice is built-out at a later stage of inner-sourcing.

## Create simple ways to discover projects under Inner-sourcing
At this stage, we should aim for simple UI, which allows people to search projects under inner-sourcing. The goal is to show -
1. What the project does
2. Where is link to repo
3. How many contributors
4. How many releases and the recent release
5. Link to contribution page

# Measuring Metrics
You can now have additional metrics showcasing value
