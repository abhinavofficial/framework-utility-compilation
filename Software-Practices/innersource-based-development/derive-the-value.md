# Derive the value
Congratulations. If you are now on this page, you have successfully 
* Initiated your inner source project started, and have started getting contribution.
* Collected metrics around meeting cadence and inner-sourcing goals.

So far, you might have worked within a small group of people, who understand the project well. The contributors are mostly developers to a project. You have been requesting invites for contribution in various forum, explaining code change is not the only way to contribute. Now is the time to emphasise the point

## Building ecosystem around your project
The projects need not be elaborate. We typically target the medium size project in our attempt to start small. But, the overall ecosystem thrives when there are many small modularized projects, solving very specific purpose. These smaller project must again have the same thought process as a regular medium to large project. It must clearly define its purpose, way to usage, etc.
