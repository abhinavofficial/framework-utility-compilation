# Derive the value
Congratulations. If you are now on this page, you have successfully 
* Initiated your inner source project started, and have started getting contribution.
* Collected metrics around meeting cadence and inner-sourcing goals.

The value of an inner-source projects can really be derived if
* Projects are being supported in a thriving environment supported by diverse people
* Projects grow organically to build ecosystem to support various business functions

So far, you might have worked within a small group of people, who understand the project well. The contributors are mostly developers to the project. You have been requesting invites for contribution in various forum, explaining code change is not the only way to contribute. Now is the time to publicize the point more, and look for contribution beyond developers.

I strongly recommended to support other projects at this stage. Ideal way to move forward is to expand the  

The goal of this stage is to show inner-sourcing for the selected project is working, supported by metrics.

## Building interest for contribution
Contributing to inner source project can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill you can imagine.

### Why to contribute?
* Improve software you rely on: Wouldn't it be nice to contribute and improve software that you use?
* Improve existing skills: An inner-source project needs interdisciplinary team of coders, testers, writers, analysts, organizers, promoters, sponsors, etc. If you’re looking for practice or learning or autonomy, there’s a task for you on an open source project.
* Networking with like-minded people. Wouldn't it be nice to build relationship who can help you in your career growth - discuss / learn / teach people of similar aspirations and build people skills?

### What it means to contribute?
Contributing to an open source is a daunting task, especially the matured ones. Inner-sourced projects are relatively simpler - there is a lot of support available within the organization to help you with it.

You can contribute as coder, designer, testers, technical writer, analysts, teaching and helping people to understand / code / use, organizing events, or suggesting new ideas within the scope of its vision.

At this stage, the inner-sourced projects are conducting knowledge sharing sessions - join them and show your interest. They have an elaborate documentation about how to contribute - get on with it. Follow what the project expects as contribution and respect their way of working - you can suggest changes when you have deep understanding of those projects.

## Building ecosystem around your project
We typically target the medium size project in our attempt to start small. But, not all projects need be elaborate. The overall ecosystem thrives when there are many small modularized projects, solving very specific purpose and works in complement with medium to large project extending its functionality or usage. 

For example, Apache Spark aims to support a rich ecosystem of libraries. Many new useful utilities or features belong outside of Spark rather than in the core. For example: language support probably has to be a part of core Spark, but, useful machine learning algorithms can happily exist outside MLlib. To that end, large and independent new functionality is often rejected for inclusion in Spark itself, but, can and should be hosted as a separate project and repository, and included in the spark-packages.org collection.

These smaller project must again have the same thought process as a regular medium to large project - i.e. it must clearly define its purpose, way to usage, CI-CD, how to contribute, etc.

> This also means, while developing the inner-source project, you must think about how functionalities can be extended / overridden / etc. This should be one of the core design principle while designing your inner-source projects


# Measuring Metrics
You can now have additional metrics showcasing value
