# Proving the point

Congratulations. If you are now on this page, you have successfully initiated your inner source project started, and have started getting contribution. It is time for you to check the effectiveness of the inner sourcing of your project.

The goal of this stage is to show inner-sourcing for the selected project is working, supported by metrics.

## Checking on Cadence
While defining way of working, you would have established cadence for meetings, new ideas, monthly knowledge sharing sessions, etc. You should record for example, people in attendance and # of new ideas generated. This can be a good indicator of proving the point.

These would also feed into the next section - deriving the value.
