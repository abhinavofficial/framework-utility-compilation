## Steps to developing a usable algorithm

* Model the problem
* Find an algorithm to solve it
* Fast enough? Fits in memory?

  * Find a way to address the problem
  * Iterate until satisfied.

This is a Scientific method to design and analyzing algorithms, where we build Mathematical model to analysis what's going on.
