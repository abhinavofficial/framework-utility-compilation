LRU Cache is all about these 3 cases - Questions would be based upon these 3 cases each;
Expiration
Priority
Least used / recently used

Developing a component using DSA
LRU cache

They will be assessing based upon these parameters;
-> How you handle edge case
-> How you used DS & collection
-> How you implement the solution

Link for LRU Preparation: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lru-cache-implementation/


Keeping Strong hold on Trees & Binary search Trees for solving this problem. Using DSA how will approach faster results. Therefore, your approach for retrieving faster results is very prominent here for solving all the given cases.

You have to design a Cache - expiration time is given along with the priority data needs to be kept. You have to design the Cache

You should have knowledge about Caching , Data Structure to optimize the problem & Basic fundamental.. Plain/ Simple Cache will not do

Eviction should be based upon expiration then priority like that you have to design
Basically in-depth software development skills are checked
At a time only certain number of cache can be available what if new cache comes? Logic needed to be implemented based on given criteria.

Nothing more. Purely software development skills demonstration and live test
They gave example of cache memory utilisation along with removal criteria
We need to evict an expired  item
Least possible used item

How to implement hashmap
How to find index in array
How does hashing work
How to manage collision
How to implement heap
Linklist
LRU

binary trees
link list
different eviction strategy
hashmap
internal hashing work
how to implement heap
LRU
Comparater ka defination
how to handle Collisions
This might be discussed with you in all tech discussion
[09/08, 9:38 pm] BP HR: Least frequently used cache..
Low level design
more on the low level design on how are we going to implement it..
