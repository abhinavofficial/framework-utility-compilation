# Fundamentals of algorithms

## Why is algorithm important?

## Reasons to analyze algorithms
* Predict performance
* Compare algorithms
* Provide guarantees
* Understand theoretical basis
* Avoid performance bugs

> Client get poor performance because programmer did not understand performance characteristics.
