## Use cases

AI is a generic technology that can do much more than providing a metric.

### Using Sound
AI can be taught to listen to the differences between sound with the incorrect air filter and the one with new filter. We can train them with more careful data gathering techniques so that the AI algorithms don't have to deal with figure-ground issues.

Stethoscope, Regurgitation (Diastole, Systole), Echo 2D, etc. are some other examples where sound is used in medical fields.

Detecting Tracheobronchitis, Vocal fold polyps, Broncopulmonary dysplasia can be detected through change in voice. AI can help here eliminating the need of a very qualified personal to detect these conditions.

### Car Manufacture
Phone can detect if there is an imbalance between the car wheels.
