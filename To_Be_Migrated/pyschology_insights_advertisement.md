- We pay attention to things that are already in our minds.
- üî• Pro tip: Know how your customers feel when they need your product the most. You'll create better interactions.

## Customer Fatigue

- When companies overuse a tactic (as seen with the NPS surveys), people will slowly start filtering out the information. What worked before will not necessarily work again.
- Just like the Kano model, today's delighters will soon become expected in a few years.2 That's why you constantly need to innovate!

## A good adverstiment

- üî¢ Pseudo-Set Framing: Tasks part of a group are more tempting to complete. (so you don't stop reading after one line!)
