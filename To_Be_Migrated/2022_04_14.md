- Hick's Law
	- : It describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices: increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time logarithmically. The Hick–Hyman law assesses cognitive information capacity in choice reaction experiments. The amount of time taken to process a certain amount of bits in the Hick–Hyman law is known as the rate of gain of information.
	- Hick's law is sometimes cited to justify menu design decisions.
- Goodhart's Law: Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes. Proposed by Charles Goodhart in 1975.
	- Marilyn Strathern in 1997 generalized in 1997: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.
	- Keith Hoskins: Goodhart's Law—That every measure which becomes a target becomes a bad measure—is inexorably, if ruefully, becoming recognized as one of the overriding laws of our times.
