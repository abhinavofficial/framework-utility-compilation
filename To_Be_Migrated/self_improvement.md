## The power of habit by Charles Duhigg

- The process of turning a sequence of actions into an automatic routine is known as chunking and it forms the basis of all habit formation. Habit can be broken down into a three part loop:
  - First you sense an **external cue** - which sparks your brain activity as your brain decides which habit is appropriate for the situation
  - Next comes **routine** - the activity you are used to performing when faced with this particular cue
  - Finally you get a **reward**, a feeling of success
- Habit stick because this creates a craving
- To change a habit, substitute a routine with another, and **believe** in the change. Don't try to resist the craving, redirect it.
- Change can be achieved by focusing on keystone habits and achieving small wins.
- Willpower is the most important keystone habit. Willpower is like a muscle, it can tire. By engaging in habit that demands resolution, you can strengthen your willpower. If you are prepared situation, you can muster more willpower. If people do something on command, their willpower muscle will get tired much quicker.
- A crisis can change organizational habits, and sometimes required.
- Companies take advantage of habits in their marketing. New habits or products are far more likely to be accepted if they don't seem new.
- Movement are born from strong ties (first hand relationship with plenty of people from across different social segments of our community), peer pressure (via week ties - which are acquaintances rather than friends) and new habits.
- We bear responsibilities for changing our habits.
