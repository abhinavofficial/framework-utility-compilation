- Learnt about [Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/blog/2022-introducing-garage/). "Garage is a distributed storage solution, that automatically replicates your data on several servers. Garage takes into account the geographical location of servers, and ensures that copies of your data are located at different locations when possible for maximal redundancy, a unique feature in the landscape of distributed storage systems.". I guess the documentation is okay. https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/documentation/quick-start/
