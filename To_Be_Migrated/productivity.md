## Getting Things Done by David Allen

- The Getting Things Done process helps you make intuitive decisions based on priorities
- When people get a sense of how to execute, they automatically focus on the bigger game
- When I learn to get control of my life, I can do it for the rest of my life
- Pay attention to what has my attention.. and engage with it appropriately
- Capture - collect what has your capturing your mind / idea.
  - Mind sweep - Removing things from your mind that have your attention
  - Idea to close open loops. My mind is for having ideas, not for holding them.
    - Physical In-tray (Paper pen, notebook)
    - Online In-tray (Smart phone, voicemail, etc.)
- Clarify - what it really means to you
  - What attention that is really required
  - Decision making - how and when and what are you going to do about it, if at all.
    - Is it something that is actionable? This is done during the cleaning up.
      - Yes
        - What is the very next action?
          - Will it take less than 2 minutes?
            - Yes. Do it right then.
            - No.
              - Can it be delegated? If so, delegate it.
              - Defer it and park in appropriate place (see organize below)
      - No / May be
        - Should I sending in trash?
        - Incubate - In future
        - Reference Material
- Organize - put it where it belongs
  - Defer it and park in
    - a Calendar
    - Next-actions list by categories
      - Project list (An outcome resulting from actions)
      - Waiting list where you are waiting on from someone
- Reflect - Review frequently
  - Review frequently to ensure that you have the bigger picture and that things are under control, renegotiate if you have to, to get things under control

    - Look forward and backward on my calendar
    - Schedule time at the end of every week
- Engage - Do what needs to be done
  - Focus on the moment
  - Where do I put my focus and attention
- 2 years of implementing so it becomes a habit. If I fall off, I will come back on - sit, empty your head, make next-action decisions.
- Every conversation should include what is to be accomplished, and by what time - and someone should track those agreements. Lead by example.
