# Private & Permissioned Blockchain

## Introduction
* The main Ethereum blockchain is public and permissionless - also called Mainnet
* Ethereum has multiple public testnets like GÃ¶rli, Kovan, Rinkeby, and Ropsten
* Anyone can create a private blockchain
  * For testing and development
  * For specific use cases, generally within a domain
* Has no direct connection with the mainnet
  * Same node/client can connect to mainnet and your private chain
  * No common accounts, state, or value transfer
* Why use Ethereum (or any other public blockchain) protocol then?
  * Dependable, tested, and secure protocol, node implementations, and tools
  * Availability of developers and administrators with deep knowledge
  * Benefit from new updates and feature/tool development
  * Similar to using open source libraries in a closed source product

## Differentiation
* Public
  * Inherently assumed to be permissionless
  * All the popular ones like bitcoin, ethereum mainnet, etc.
  * Account identity is private but transactions are transparent
* Fully Private
  * Owned by one single entity and used within their system
  * A distributed decentralized ledger with cryptographic immutability, but not really a blockchain
  * Controlled joining and identity sharing - creator can control mining, transaction type, etc.
  * Useful for development and testing
  * Useful within a large organization or a group to store demonstrably immutable data
* Permissioned Private
  * Mix of both worlds
  * Generally run by a domain-based consortium or a federation
  * Different roles based on identity verification
  * Account identity is public (to creators) but transactions are private (from the outside world)
  * Example - Ripple (real-time settlement between banks), Quorum (built by JP Morgan finance-domain, consortium-based)

## Benefits
* Low transaction fees - Creator can set any level for transaction/gas fees
* Better efficiency and throughput - Can choose consensus protocols other than PoW to reduce computation cost and increase block creation rate
* Less congestion - Controlled network will have fewer and more controlled transactions
* Enterprise-preferred - Strikes a balance between transparency and regulation
* Access control levels - Creators can define different levels of access, limit mining to a specific group,limit type and value of transactions based on levels, etc.
* Can regulate and hence disallow illegal activity based on various regional laws
* Limits identity and transaction transparency - Required in some domains

## Drawbacks
* Not trustless - Controlled by the creator group, creates inherent trust dependency
* Limits transparency leading to reduced trust by individuals
* Immutability is not guaranteed
* More prone to be manipulated bya bad actor with sufficient permissions

## Application

* **Financial Services**
* Controlled financial interactions between equivalent players - gross bank settlement, P2P transaction settlement, efficient global payments, trade finance, federation (Bankchain)
* User information with privacy - credit ratings, loan proofs, lending platforms, data exchange
* **Supply chain**
* Raw material and goods tracing across the chain - tracking and prediction
* Combined with IoT for faster and more accurate worldview
* Applies to food, clothing, precious metals/gems, electronics, and more
* **Media and Entertainment** - In-game currency, music royalty platform, content verification
* **Identity** - Digital encrypted identity docs with controlled access and audit trail, deep integration with Govt, Education, Banking & Insurance, Healthcare, Employers, etc.
* **Insurance** - Data validation, automated claim processing, KYC and money laundering protection, high-value item tracker, etc.
* **Healthcare** - Secure patient data sharing, digital record management
* **Other domains** - Employment, Education, Manufacturing, Real Estate
