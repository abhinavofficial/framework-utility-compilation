Rust utility, learning-butler, helps you stay on-course. Code documentation should happen as you build.

| Symbol    | 	Explanation            |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| //	       | Line comment            |
| //!	      | Inner line doc comment  |
| ///	      | Outer line doc comment  |
| /*...*/	  | Block comment           |
| /*!...*/	 | Inner block doc comment |
| /**...*/	 | Outer block doc comment |

All the learnings are grouped by Month Year. I am assuming I will not be learning/reading more than 10-15 items a month. So, it should be manageable. These learnings should be managed in markdown files.
